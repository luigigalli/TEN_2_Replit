# Team Updates

This directory contains important updates and notifications for the development team. Unlike the `/docs` directory which contains static documentation about the project's architecture and setup, this space is for time-sensitive communications and required actions.

## Directory Structure

- `changelog.md`: Chronological list of significant changes
- `action-items.md`: Current tasks requiring team attention
- `credentials.md`: Credential rotation schedules and updates
- `known-issues.md`: Current issues being tracked
- `breaking-changes.md`: Notifications about upcoming breaking changes
