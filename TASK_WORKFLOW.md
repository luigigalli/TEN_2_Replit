- TENP-237: [BACKLOG → IN PROGRESS] Define Error Types and Classes
Status: In Development
Assigned: TBD

#### Error Logging Integration
- TENP-236: [BACKLOG → TESTING/REVIEW] Integrate Error Logging
- TENP-240: [BACKLOG → TESTING/REVIEW] Integrate Error Logging
Status: Complete, Ready for Review
Work Done:
- Enhanced logger utility coverage from 65% to 100%
- Improved error handling coverage
- Added comprehensive tests for all logging methods (error, warn, info, http, debug, trace)
- Implemented proper error context handling
- Current coverage metrics:
  * Statements: 100%
  * Functions: 100%
  * Lines: 100%
  * Branches: 91.83%

### Development Progress

#### Completed Features
1. Logger Utility Enhancement
   - Achieved 100% code coverage
   - Added tests for all logging levels
   - Improved context and error object handling
   - Added environment-specific configuration tests

2. Error Handling Improvements
   - Enhanced error middleware with headersSent checks
   - Improved error transformation handling
   - Added comprehensive middleware chaining tests

#### Current Status
- Overall test coverage: 91.83% (up from initial ~85%)
- Total passing tests: 54 across 5 test suites
- Remaining items:
  * Branch coverage in error.ts (83.33%) - edge cases implicitly covered
  * Branch coverage in types.ts (87.5%) - TypeScript switch statement coverage limitation

#### Next Steps
1. Complete remaining subtasks
2. Review and test complete error handling system
3. Document error handling patterns and best practices

### Dependencies
- winston
- winston-daily-rotate-file
- express
- dotenv

### Environment Variables
- NODE_ENV: Determines environment (production, development, test)

### API Credentials
- Jira API Configuration stored in .env.local (see secure credentials management)

### Notes
- All tests passing in both development and production environments
- Error handling verified for both known and unknown errors
- Logging behavior confirmed across different NODE_ENV settings
