# The Experiences Network (TEN) - Project Log

## Project Overview
The Experiences Network (TEN) is a platform for creating, discovering, and booking unique experiences. The platform connects experience creators with participants, handling everything from discovery to booking and payment processing.

## Project Structure
- Root Directory: `/Users/luigigalli/CascadeProjects/TEN_2_Replit/`
- Key Directories:
  - `/scripts/jira/`: Contains Jira integration scripts
  - More directories will be added as development progresses

## Development Timeline

### 2025-01-09
1. **Initial Project Setup and Decisions**
   - Chose Express.js with TypeScript for backend development
     - Rationale: Strong typing, better maintainability, and extensive ecosystem
   - Decided to implement a modular architecture
     - Core API Framework as foundation
     - Separate modules for user management, experiences, bookings
   - Prioritized testing from the start
     - All features must have corresponding tests
     - Test-driven development approach for core components

2. **Jira Project Configuration**
   - Created Jira project with key: `TENP`
   - Base URL: `https://the-experiences-network.atlassian.net`
   - API Version: 2
   - Created initial epics for major features:
     - Platform Foundation
     - User Management
     - Experience Creation
     - Booking System
     - Payment Integration
     - Search & Discovery
     - Social Features
     - Analytics & Reporting
     - Mobile Optimization
     - Platform Security

3. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Created Jira integration scripts for task management
   - Implemented authentication using API tokens for security
   - Scripts created:
     - `list_tasks.py`: For viewing all project tasks
     - `move_to_selected.py`: For task workflow management
     - `track_progress.py`: For monitoring development progress

4. **Task Selection Strategy**
   - Decided to start with foundational tasks:
     - Core API setup and error handling
     - Database architecture and validation
     - Testing infrastructure
   - Rationale: Building strong foundation before feature development
   - Selected specific tasks that form a complete development cycle
   - Ensured testing tasks are paired with development tasks

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture
1. **Backend Stack**
   - Express.js with TypeScript
   - Modular architecture for scalability
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - API-first design approach

2. **Development Process**
   - Test-driven development for core components
   - Continuous Integration from the start
   - Documentation as part of definition of done

### Testing Strategy
1. **Comprehensive Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for all core functionality
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Database testing utilities
   - Test data management system

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - All tasks must pass testing before completion
   - Automated testing in CI pipeline
   - Documentation requirements for APIs

## Current Focus
- Setting up the development environment
- Implementing core API framework
- Establishing database architecture
- Creating testing infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of core API framework tasks
2. Set up development environment with Express.js and TypeScript
3. Design and implement database schema
4. Establish testing frameworks and practices

## Important Notes
- All tasks must pass testing before being considered complete
- Documentation is required for all APIs and major components
- Focus on maintainable, well-documented code
- Regular updates to project log for tracking decisions

## Useful Commands
```bash
# List all tasks in project
python3 scripts/jira/list_tasks.py

# Track progress of selected tasks
python3 scripts/jira/track_progress.py

# Move tasks to "Selected for Development"
python3 scripts/jira/move_to_selected.py
```
