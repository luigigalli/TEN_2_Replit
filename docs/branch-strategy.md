# Branch Strategy Documentation

## Core Branches
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for feature development

## Development Workflow

### Issue Tracking with GitHub Issues

#### Issue Naming Conventions
1. **Issue Title Format**: `[Type][Component] Brief description of the issue`
   - Example: `[Feature][Auth] Add biometric authentication support`
   - Example: `[Bug][Database] Fix user session persistence`
   - Example: `[Enhancement][API] Optimize trip search performance`

2. **Issue Types**:
   - `[Feature]`: New functionality or major additions
   - `[Bug]`: Error fixes and problem resolutions
   - `[Enhancement]`: Improvements to existing features
   - `[Environment]`: Environment-specific configurations
   - `[Documentation]`: Documentation updates and improvements
   - `[Database]`: Schema changes and data operations
   - `[Security]`: Security-related changes
   - `[Performance]`: Performance optimizations

3. **Component Tags**:
   - `[Auth]`: Authentication/Authorization
   - `[API]`: API endpoints and services
   - `[Database]`: Database operations
   - `[UI]`: User interface components
   - `[Config]`: Configuration changes
   - `[Sync]`: Synchronization operations
   - `[Test]`: Testing infrastructure
   - `[CI]`: Continuous Integration

4. **Issue Description Requirements**:
   - Clear problem/requirement statement
   - Environment considerations noted
   - Related components tagged
   - Priority level assigned (P0-P3)
   - Acceptance criteria defined
   - Technical approach outlined
   - Cross-environment impact noted

### Branching Rules
1. New Features & Improvements:
   - Create temporary branch from `develop`
   - Follow naming: `issue-[NUMBER]-brief-description`
   - Merge back to `develop` when complete
   - Delete branch after successful merge

2. Production Bug Fixes:
   - Create temporary branch from `main` only for urgent fixes
   - Follow naming: `hotfix-[NUMBER]-brief-description`
   - Merge to both `main` and `develop`
   - Delete branch after successful merge

### Environment-Specific Git Strategies
- Replit: Use rebase strategy
- Windsurf: Use fast-forward only

## Branch Protection Rules
1. Main Branch (`main`)
   - Requires pull request review
   - Must be up-to-date before merging
   - Status checks must pass
   - Linear history enforced

2. Development Branch (`develop`)
   - Requires pull request review
   - Must be up-to-date before merging
   - Status checks must pass

## Issue Management
1. Issue Creation
   - Follow naming convention strictly
   - Use appropriate issue type and component tags
   - Include environment considerations
   - Tag related components
   - Set priority level (P0-P3)

2. Issue Workflow
   - Create temporary branch
   - Implement changes
   - Submit pull request
   - Close issue after merge

3. Issue Priority Levels
   - P0: Critical (Production blocking, security vulnerabilities)
   - P1: High (Major feature, important bug fix)
   - P2: Medium (Enhancement, non-critical bug)
   - P3: Low (Minor improvements, documentation)

## Pull Request Process
1. Create PR with reference to issue
2. Include comprehensive description
3. Add relevant reviewers
4. Pass all status checks
5. Obtain required approvals
6. Merge using appropriate strategy
7. Delete temporary branch

## Best Practices
1. Keep branches short-lived
2. Use clear, descriptive branch names
3. Reference issue numbers in commits
4. Keep changes focused and atomic
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Follow issue naming conventions strictly
7. Maintain clear issue descriptions
8. Cross-reference related issues
9. Keep PR scope minimal

## Cross-Environment Considerations
1. Always note environment impact in issues
2. Test changes in both environments
3. Document environment-specific configurations
4. Verify sync operations when needed
5. Update environment validation as required
