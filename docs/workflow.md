# Development Workflow Guide

This document outlines the development workflow for our application, designed to be platform-agnostic while supporting specific deployment environments.

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for feature development

### Feature Branches
- `feat/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `env/*`: Environment-specific configurations
- `docs/*`: Documentation updates

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request (PR) Guidelines
1. **Create Descriptive PRs**
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of modifications
   - Link to related issues or tickets
   - List of affected environments

2. **Review Requirements**
   - At least one approval from the available environment team
   - All automated tests pass in the available environment
   - Documentation updated as needed
   - No merge conflicts with target branch

3. **Environment Availability**
   - If both environments are available:
     - Reviews required from both teams
     - Tests must pass in both environments
   - If one environment is unavailable:
     - Review and testing from available environment team is sufficient
     - Document any environment-specific considerations for future testing

## Documentation Structure

### Platform-Agnostic Documentation
1. **Core Documentation**
   - `README.md`: Project overview and setup
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: System design and components
   - `API.md`: API specifications and endpoints
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Contribution guidelines

2. **Technical Documentation**
   - Database schema and relationships
   - Authentication and authorization flows
   - Component interactions
   - State management

3. **Universal Changelog**
   - Version history
   - Breaking changes
   - Migration guides
   - Deprecation notices

### Environment-Specific Documentation
1. **Environment Guides**
   - Configuration requirements
   - Deployment procedures
   - Environment variables
   - Known limitations

2. **Environment Changelogs**
   - Environment-specific updates
   - Configuration changes
   - Performance optimizations

## Testing Strategy

### Core Testing
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Platform-independent business logic
   - Data models and utilities
   - Component rendering

2. **Integration Tests**
   - API endpoints
   - Database operations
   - Authentication flows

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - User workflows
   - Critical paths
   - Error scenarios

### Environment Testing
1. **Configuration Tests**
   - Environment variable validation
   - Connection handling
   - SSL/TLS verification

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Load testing (when applicable)
   - Connection pooling
   - Resource utilization

## Feature Development Process

1. **Planning**
   - Define requirements
   - Identify affected components
   - Consider cross-environment compatibility

2. **Implementation**
   - Create feature branch
   - Write platform-agnostic code
   - Add necessary environment checks
   - Update documentation

3. **Testing**
   - Run core test suite
   - Test in available environment(s)
   - Document environment-specific behaviors

4. **Review and Merge**
   - Submit PR
   - Address review feedback
   - Update documentation
   - Merge when approved

## Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment**
   - Version bump if needed
   - Update changelogs
   - Run final tests

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to available environment(s)
   - Verify deployment success
   - Monitor for issues

3. **Post-deployment**
   - Update documentation
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Monitor performance

## Continuous Integration

1. **Automated Checks**
   - Code linting
   - Type checking
   - Unit tests
   - Build verification

2. **Environment Validation**
   - Configuration validation
   - Environment variable checks
   - Connection testing

## Emergency Procedures

1. **Critical Issues**
   - Immediate notification to available teams
   - Hotfix branch creation
   - Expedited review process

2. **Rollback Procedures**
   - Version rollback steps
   - Data recovery procedures
   - Incident documentation

## Version Control Best Practices

1. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Clear, descriptive messages
   - Reference issues/tickets
   - One logical change per commit

2. **Branch Management**
   - Regular rebasing with target branch
   - Clean up merged branches
   - Tag significant versions

## Support and Communication

1. **Issue Tracking**
   - Bug reports
   - Feature requests
   - Environment-specific issues

2. **Team Communication**
   - Regular sync meetings
   - Documentation updates
   - Cross-environment coordination
